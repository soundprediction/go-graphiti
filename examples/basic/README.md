# Basic Go-Graphiti Example (Neo4j + OpenAI)

This example demonstrates using go-graphiti with external services: Neo4j database and OpenAI APIs.

> **Note**: For the recommended minimal setup, see the [Kuzu + Ollama example](../kuzu_ollama/) which requires no external dependencies.

## Features

This example shows how to:
- Create and configure a Graphiti client with external Neo4j database and OpenAI APIs
- Add episodes (data) to the knowledge graph
- Search the knowledge graph for relevant information

**When to use this setup:**
- Production deployments requiring shared database access
- Teams needing to collaborate on a shared knowledge graph
- Applications requiring cloud-scale databases
- When you prefer managed services over embedded solutions

## Prerequisites

**External Services Required:**

1. **Neo4j Database**: A running Neo4j instance
   - Default connection: `bolt://localhost:7687`
   - You can run Neo4j locally using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run --name neo4j -p 7687:7687 -p 7474:7474 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j:latest
     ```
   - Or use Neo4j Aura (cloud) or Neo4j Desktop

2. **OpenAI API Key**: An active OpenAI API key for LLM and embedding services
   - Sign up at https://platform.openai.com/
   - Requires API credits for usage

> **Alternative**: For a setup requiring no external services, see the [Kuzu + Ollama example](../kuzu_ollama/)

## Environment Variables

### Required
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `NEO4J_PASSWORD`: Your Neo4j database password

### Optional
- `NEO4J_URI`: Neo4j connection URI (default: `bolt://localhost:7687`)
- `NEO4J_USER`: Neo4j username (default: `neo4j`)

## Usage

1. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   export NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password_here
   ```

2. Run the example:
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

3. Or build and run:
   ```bash
   go build -o basic_example .
   ./basic_example
   ```

## Example Output

When run successfully, you'll see output similar to:
```
🚀 Starting go-graphiti basic example
   Neo4j URI: bolt://localhost:7687
   Neo4j User: neo4j

## Testing

Run the tests to verify everything works correctly:
```bash
go test -v ./...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Environment Variables
If you see error messages about missing environment variables, the example will provide helpful instructions on how to set them up.

### Neo4j Connection Issues
- Ensure Neo4j is running and accessible at the configured URI
- Verify your username and password are correct
- Check that the Neo4j ports (7687, 7474) are not blocked by a firewall

### OpenAI API Issues
- Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check your OpenAI API usage limits

## What This Example Demonstrates

1. **Client Setup**: How to create and configure all the necessary clients (Neo4j, OpenAI LLM, OpenAI Embedder, Graphiti)
2. **Data Ingestion**: Adding structured episodes to the knowledge graph
3. **Information Retrieval**: Searching the knowledge graph with natural language queries
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing dependencies or configuration issues
